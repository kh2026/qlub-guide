Stem Cell Society,"The Harvard College Stem Cell Society is a student organization dedicated to cultivating the interests of students in stem cells and regenerative biology, and to advancing stem cell science by raising awareness and promoting education about the complex concerns surrounding stem cell research. Since their discovery, stem cells have been a fascinating subject of research and a useful tool for genetic manipulations in the laboratory. Due to several seminal discoveries in the recent past, there has been a surge in interest in stem cells and their potential for regenerative therapies in humans; this surge is also seen amongst students at Harvard College.          The goals of the HCSCS extend far beyond merely the science of stem cell research into the realms of politics, law, ethics and morality. Furthermore, the field is filled with myths and misconceptions that have led to negative public responses in the past years. Our organization plans to address these issues by hosting a wide variety of events on campus such as lectures by famous stem cell biologists, and journal clubs to keep students up-to-date on recent discoveries. In addition, our organization will attempt to demystify stem cell research in the eyes of the public and promote stem cell research as a possible career path for the younger generation. Lastly, because our organization will provide students on campus with the support, knowledge and resources to further pursue their interests in stem cells and regenerative biology, we hope to establish a collaborative network of undergraduate researchers with a strong sense of community, using the HCSCS as a forum to voice their opinions and to make friends who share the common interest of stem cells and regenerative biology.",harvardcollegestemcell@gmail.com,http://harvardcollegestemcell.squarespace.com

Student Theater Advancing Growth &amp; Empowerment (S.T.A.G.E.),"Harvard STAGE was conceived by Harvard students as a way to bridge the disconnect between the college and the surrounding community and to emphasize the connection between theater and public service in general. STAGE does so by bringing college students together with their younger peers to grow through theater and by bringing the broader community together to support it.          STAGE recruits members at the start of each semester. Members are Harvard students with a talent and interest in any or all of the following areas: theatrical performance, dance, oratory, directing, producing, technical design (lights, costumes, set, sound, props), choreography, music directing, script writing/score composing, etc. Members must also have a distinguished record of public service and must commit to weekly involvement working with the middle school children in STAGE??s after-school program.          Throughout the school year, STAGE members run a weekly after-school program serving children who would otherwise have little or no exposure to the performing arts. STAGE uses a curriculum designed to introduce children to the basics of theatrical performance, emphasizing the importance of creativity, communication skills, and self-esteem. STAGE members work with the children to help them develop their own theatrical pieces, both reality-based and imaginative.           In April,, STAGE hosts STAGE Spectacular - a day-long whirlwind tour in which after-school participants are introduced to all aspects of the performing arts by working with different Harvard student arts organizations.           STAGE&#39;s afterschool program culminates in a showcase of the students&#39; pieces at the end of the year on campus, intended to highlight the achievements of the students and to raise awareness of the potential for the arts in the community.",harvardstage@gmail.com,http://pbha.org/stage

Wine Society,"Pliny the Elder&#39;s wise words &quot;in vino veritas&quot; illustrate the belief that in wine there is truth. To illuminate another interpretation of the old Latin adage, the Harvard College Wine Society was founded in 2011 with the philosophy of re-establishing the European tradition of respecting and revering wine.          Concerned with the culture of binge drinking on college campuses, we aim to promote social drinking in a responsible environment by cultivating an appreciation and understanding of wine. We provide a common space for undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty members to meet and interact through the enjoyment of wine.          We arrange a number of tastings throughout the semester. The majority of tastings are organized by grape variety and showcase wines from all around the world. Tastings are hosted by connoisseurs and more experienced members of the Society. We also invite guest speakers such as winemakers and wine educators to give lectures on various topics in oenology, including viniculture and vinification. Lastly, we hold wine and cheese pairing events where students have the chance to mix and mingle with faculty members and graduate students.",harvardcollegewinesociety@gmail.com,-
